    <richText>The sociologist such as Goffman and many others have studied human behaviour through observations for many decades. Many examined and defined human face-to-face interactions.&#xD;For example, Goffman in his &#x201C;Behaviour in public places&#x201D;, defined the term &lt;i&gt;encounter &lt;/i&gt;as &#x201C;all those instances of two or more people in a situation joining each other openly in maintaining a single focus of cognitive and visual attention, entailing preferential communication rights&#x201D;. &#xD;&#xD;We as technologists and scientists sometimes forget the amount of useful observations and insights that the sociologists offer.  In our recent work, my colleagues and I revisited some of Goffman findings and used them to create a model for human encounter which could be detected using simple colocation technology without the need of  invasive sensing technology (e.g., monitoring conversations or sound). &#xD;&#xD;We achieved that based on two simple parameters of size and the duration of the encounter. Simply put we know that for a meaningful conversation the duration needs to be at least 1 minute long (a), and based on &#x201C;ceremonial rituals&#x201D; observations from sociologist we know that as the size of the group increases the duration increases sub-linearly(b). This means, for example, while a two minute encounter for 2 persons could be long enough for a social chat, a 5 persons encounter might require more than 5 minutes. And finally, as the duration increases the likelihood of encounter between a large group of people decreases.  &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Putting these three simple concepts in to a model we expect human encounters to fit a log normal distribution (d), and if they do follow such distribution we can then apply similar reasoning to detect those short-lived spontaneous encounters.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;In our paper, we show how we tested this model on an enterprise dataset, and how we deployed a system which leverages WiFi signals from ordinary phones (with no need for specific applications) to detect encounters in a field study in our offices. &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
